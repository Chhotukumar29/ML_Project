# Project Title
## Automated Water Quality Prediction System using Machine Learning

Project Description
Provide a brief overview of your project.

The Automated Water Quality Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict water quality parameters in various bodies of water. This system employs advanced machine learning models and historical water quality data to forecast key parameters such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and more. By utilizing cutting-edge technology, this project aims to assist environmental researchers, water resource managers, and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding water quality maintenance and preservation.
